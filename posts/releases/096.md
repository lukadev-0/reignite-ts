# Release 096.1 (Preview) WORK IN PROGRESS

This commit mostly refactored the system to partially follow Google's Typescript Style Guide to allow for easier code readability and maintainability.

The following changes were made:

-   All classes are now PascalCase
-   All interfaces are now PascalCase
-   All enums are now PascalCase
-   All types are now PascalCase

-   All constants are now SNAKE_CASE
-   All variables are now camelCase
-   All functions are now camelCase

-   Cleared most boilerplate (by including public in methods and properties)
-   Exports do not use default anymore

## Changes

-   The `Matrix3d.lookAt` method properly calculates the matrix now, previously it
    returned a matrix that were -X, Y, -Z instead of X, Y, Z, which introduced a subtle
    issue with the camera rendering. This has been fixed entirely preventing issues
    arising from this further on.
-   TypeDoc is now added back and is making documentation for the project again due to
    the refactoring of the codebase. Originally this was discontinued due to usage of
    default exports, which is no longer the case.
-   The Q and E keys are now used to lower and raise the camera, respectively.
-   The scroll wheel is now used to zoom in and out of the camera.

# Release 096.0-pre.1 (Preview)

## New Features

-   Currently testing the Electron library for a simplified development workflow.
-   The configuration has been tested for tweaking, further refinement is required

## Changes

-   The default font is now imported as a local asset, instead of being a user font
