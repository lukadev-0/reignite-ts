# reignite-ts

A typescript game engine for the browser.

## Goals

- [ ] 2D / 3D rendering
- [ ] Be similar to Roblox's System
- [ ] Simple to use

## Why?

I wanted to make a game engine in TypeScript. I've seen the potentials of it and I wanted to make a game engine that I could use to make games, hence reimakesgames.

## How?

I don't know either, it just will work.

## What?

It's a game engine, what else?

## Will feature

* 2D / 3D rendering
* Datatypes
* Events
* Tilemaps and Tilesets
* GUI

## Building

1. Install dev dependencies: `npm install`
1. Build and host the game: `npm start`

You don't need to install any dependencies to run the game, but you will need to install them to build the game.

Don't use `npm run build`, it's not a complete build process. It's intended for me to be able to export a release build for the game,
while the `npm start` command is intended for development purposes. I prefer you use `npm start` to run the game.
