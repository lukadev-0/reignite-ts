# reignite-ts

A typescript game engine for the browser or standalone.

## Goals

-   [ ] 2D rendering
-   [ ] Simple 3D rendering
-   [ ] GUI
-   [ ] Tilemaps
-   [ ] Tilesets
-   [ ] Events
-   [ ] Datatypes
-   [ ] Moddable
-   [ ] Easy to use
-   [ ] Easy to learn

## Why?

I've seen the potentials of typescript as a game development language, and I wanted
to make a game engine that I could use to make games with a fast velocity in mind.

## Local Development

1. Install dev dependencies: `npm install`
1. Build and watch the game: `npm run dev`
1. Run the game: `npm start`

## Building

Work in progress. Still figuring out how to use electron-forge.
